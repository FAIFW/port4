1. Section 'Services':

1.1 lines around the faces are being calculated by JS, and change CSS variable on purpose: --faceSignWidth is 60px on initial, then after DOM is loaded, lineWidth is being changed according to size of the picture;

1.2 Unfortunately I do not currently JS classes and prototypes so modal window is being generated with some mistakes: every copy of modal is being redered by its own function. That's a reason of 500 string of very stupid and inapropriate code. This will be fixed in a fortnight;

1.3 Slider in the section 'Reviews' was made by not very nice way according to will of the client;
